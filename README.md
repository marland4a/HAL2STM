# Description

This is a LinuxCNC HAL component which aims at creating a universal serial interface to connect external IOs to LinuxCNC.
It is based on STM32, but should be portable to any other microcontroller which is fast enough.

To goal is to create a very customizable IO board, which is configured by HAL code at runtime. Feel free to contact me if you got ideas for additional features or bug fixes.



**THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT**
